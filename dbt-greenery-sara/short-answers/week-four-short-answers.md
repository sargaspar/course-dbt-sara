## Questions week 4

### **PART ONE**
#### Product funnel

We've created two funnel exposures, one that tells us our funnel overall and one that takes session_date_utc to let the user decide on a timeframe and track our funnel over time.

We've taken as a base sessions_with_pageviews but that could easily get changed to the overall count of sessions in Greenery.

| percent_sessions_with_pageview | percent_pageview_sessions_with_addtocart | percent_addtocart_sessions_with_checkout | percent_pageview_sessions_with_checkout |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.75974372664175120128 | 0.62473647224174279691 | 0.44994375703037120360 | 0.28109627547434996486 |

### **Reflection questions**

My organisation has dbt well embedded so what I'm planning to do next is review our project structure as well as all the models, tests, snapshots with the newly acquired concepts from the course. This will allow me to follow a lot easier what we have in-house, and perhaps suggest best practices to the team.

I'm excited to show the the different packages we've learned about and dbt style guide.
